                    <p class="text-muted">"Before we started working with Neera, my son’s IEP meetings felt overwhelming and confusing. Since we started working with her two years ago, everything has changed. It is still an IEP meeting so there is always stress but I finally feel informed, supported, and far less anxious walking into those meetings!" AS - Fairfax VA </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Navigating IEPs and 504 plans can feel overwhelming, especially when families are already stretched thin. Datta Advocate helps families and caregivers understand the process, prepare for meetings, and complex school documents into actionable steps. We offer tools and guidance that center student dignity and family voice, with a focus on trauma-informed collaboration and emotionally grounded advocacy.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">School Discipline & Disability Rights</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Disciplinary actions can disproportionately impact disabled students, especially when schools overlook the role of disability in behavior. Datta Advocate helps families understand how Manifestation Determination Reviews work, what rights students have, and how to respond when exclusionary practices appear. We also highlight the broader patterns that contribute to the preschool to prison pipeline, offering insight and strategy to interrupt harm before it escalates.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Housing Stability</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Housing insecurity affects everything from school attendance to access to services. Datta Advocate supports families navigating eviction risk, displacement, and systemic barriers. While we do not offer legal representation, we help families document their experiences, connect with community resources, and advocate for stability in school and public settings. Our work centers emotional support, dignity, and the recognition that housing is a foundation for educational equity.</p>
